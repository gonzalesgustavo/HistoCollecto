# HistoCollecto

This project was based off of an app created while attending college at NMHU, where OCR was utilized to capture (scan) names found on plaques at the Natural History Museum in Albuquerque New Mexico. Instead of singling out a single museum this application could easily be adapted for use at other museums (In theory). 

The idea of this application is to use QR Codes to allow users to catalog museum installments. Museums who would like to participate in this would merely have to hide small QR Codes by their display. This app would be best marketed towards young students and museum goers to have a more hands on interaction between the information seen at the museum. Making the collection of data a game and a learning experience at the same time. However, this is all theoretical for it's purpose and in general the app could be used to function differently in the lateral development of this project.   

This application in a broader sense could be linked to a back-end which would store information about the displays that a user or student could collect and use later (post museum visit). For now the data is stored locally and will re-use some of the open source data from the previous project.
